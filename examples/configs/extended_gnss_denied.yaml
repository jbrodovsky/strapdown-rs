# Extended GNSS-Denied Navigation
#
# This scenario simulates an extended period of GNSS denial (5 minutes)
# to test dead reckoning performance of the INS.
#
# Use case: Testing navigation performance in urban canyons, tunnels,
# or during intentional jamming.
#
# Expected behavior: Position error will grow during the GNSS-denied
# period at a rate proportional to IMU quality. For smartphone-grade
# MEMS IMUs, expect drift of ~10-50m per minute.
