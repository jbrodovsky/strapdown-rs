# Simple GNSS Dropout
#
# This scenario simulates brief GNSS dropouts (30 seconds)
# interspersed with normal GNSS operation.
#
# Use case: Testing filter robustness to temporary signal loss,
# such as passing under bridges or near tall buildings.
#
# Expected behavior: Position should coast accurately during
# short outages and quickly reconverge when GNSS returns.
