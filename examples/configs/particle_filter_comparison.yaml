# Particle Filter Comparison
#
# This scenario is designed for comparing UKF and Particle Filter
# performance under degraded GNSS conditions.
#
# Use case: Research on filter algorithm comparison, especially
# for non-Gaussian measurement distributions.
#
# To run comparison:
#   # UKF
#   strapdown-sim -i input.csv -o ukf_result.csv closed-loop \
#     --config particle_filter_comparison.yaml
#
#   # Particle Filter
#   strapdown-sim -i input.csv -o pf_result.csv particle-filter \
#     --config particle_filter_comparison.yaml \
#     --num-particles 200
#
# Expected behavior: Both filters should track well during GNSS
# availability. Particle filter may show better robustness to
# non-Gaussian errors but with higher computational cost.
