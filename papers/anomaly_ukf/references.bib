  abstract = {Precise underwater navigation is crucial in a number of marine applications. Navigation of most autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is based on inertial navigation. Such navigation systems drift off with time and external fixes are needed. This paper concentrates on terrain-based navigation, where position fixes are found by comparing measurements with a prior map. Nonlinear Bayesian methods like point mass and particle filters are often used for this problem. Such methods are often computationally demanding. The sigma point Kalman filter (or unscented Kalman filter) is a nonlinear filter that does not resort to local linearizations, representing the probability densities using a few deterministically chosen sigma points. The sigma point Kalman filter is not as computationally demanding as the aforementioned methods, and using real AUV data, the accuracies obtained are comparable to those of the point mass and particle filters.}

  abstract  = {The Gross Ring G is a square ring laser gyroscope, built as a monolithic Zerodur structure with 4 m length on all sides. It has demonstrated that a large ring laser provides a sensitivity high enough to measure the rotational rate of the Earth with a high precision of ΔΩE &lt; 10-8. It is possible to show that further improvement in accuracy could allow the observation of the metric frame dragging, produced by the Earth rotating mass (Lense-Thirring effect), as predicted by General Relativity. Furthermore, it can provide a local measurement of the Earth rotational rate with a sensitivity near to that provided by the international system IERS. The GINGER project is intending to take this level of sensitivity further and to improve the accuracy and the long-term stability. A monolithic structure similar to the G ring laser is not available for GINGER. Therefore the preliminary goal is the demonstration of the feasibility of a larger gyroscope structure, where the mechanical stability is obtained through an active control of the geometry. A prototype moderate size gyroscope (GP-2) has been set up in Pisa in order to test this active control of the ring geometry, while a second structure (GINGERino) has been installed inside the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in order to investigate the properties of a deep underground laboratory in view of an installation of a future GINGER apparatus. The preliminary data on these two latter instruments are presented.}

  abstract = {EGM2008 is a spherical harmonic model of the Earth's gravitational potential, developed by a least squares combination of the ITG-GRACE03S gravitational model and its associated error covariance matrix, with the gravitational information obtained from a global set of area-mean free-air gravity anomalies defined on a 5 arc-minute equiangular grid. This grid was formed by merging terrestrial, altimetry-derived, and airborne gravity data. Over areas where only lower resolution gravity data were available, their spectral content was supplemented with gravitational information implied by the topography. EGM2008 is complete to degree and order 2159, and contains additional coefficients up to degree 2190 and order 2159. Over areas covered with high quality gravity data, the discrepancies between EGM2008 geoid undulations and independent GPS/Leveling values are on the order of ±5 to ±10 cm. EGM2008 vertical deflections over USA and Australia are within ±1.1 to ±1.3 arc-seconds of independent astrogeodetic values. These results indicate that EGM2008 performs comparably with contemporary detailed regional geoid models. EGM2008 performs equally well with other GRACE-based gravitational models in orbit computations. Over EGM96, EGM2008 represents improvement by a factor of six in resolution, and by factors of three to six in accuracy, depending on gravitational quantity and geographic area. EGM2008 represents a milestone and a new paradigm in global gravity field modeling, by demonstrating for the first time ever, that given accurate and detailed gravimetric data, asingle global model may satisfy the requirements of a very wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software is ubiquitous in the Earth and ocean sciences. As a cross-platform tool producing high-quality maps and figures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world. The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new “modern mode” to complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls “classic mode.” GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes novel methods with the potential to improve the performance of navigation and tracking systems in underwater environments. The work relies on well-established methods of potential field inversion and introduces a new analytic formulation designed to stabilize the solution of the inverse problem in real-time applications. The navigation method proposed exploits the terrain information associated with geomagnetic field anomalies, without the need of a priori maps. The procedure can also be applied to track a moving vehicle based on its associated disturbance of the environmental magnetic field. We envision the integration of theses methods in terrain-aided navigation systems, simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms, and tracking applications.}

  abstract = {Satellite radar altimetry collected during a number of geodetic missions has provided a new understanding of the topography and tectonics of the deep oceans. As altimeter performance and coverage improves, smaller structures are revealed. Here we investigate the contribution of six altimeter missions that have been placed into geodetic mapping phases for more than one year. Two types of evaluations are performed. We first compare the composite (all six altimeters) grids of east and north vertical deflection to matching grids where one altimeter has been omitted evaluate their contribution versus latitude. We then estimate the noise in each altimeter by computing the median absolute deviation of the profiles with the best composite grid. Both analyses show that SARAL/AltiKa provides the greatest contribution and ERS-1 no longer provides any significant improvement. The major limitation for recovering small scale gravity features is the sea surface roughness from ocean waves. There have been steady improvements in instrumentation and processing methods that will continue into the future with higher frequency radars and interferometric swath altimeters planned for future missions.}

  abstract     = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles ({AUVs}) have been focused on by research efforts because of their extensive applications in scientific, commercial as well as military fields. However, due to the complexity of underwater environments, {AUV} navigation remains a challenging problem. This review first presents a comprehensive description of the three classical techniques of {AUV} navigation, i.e., Dead Reckoning, Signal-Based Navigation, and Map-Matching Navigation. In what follows, an in-depth survey of Integrated Navigation is given. Furthermore, a thorough discussion on Cooperative Navigation is also detailed along with an analysis of its capabilities and limitations. Finally, recent significant challenges of {AUV} navigation and further research directions are summarized.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The GNSS performance is significantly degraded in urban canyons because of the signal interferences caused by buildings. Besides the multipath and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) receptions, the diffraction effect frequently occurs in urban canyons, which will severely attenuate the signal strength when the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) transmitting path is close to the building edge. It is essential to evaluate the performance of current diffraction models for GNSS before applying mitigation. The detailed steps of applying the knife-edge model and the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD) model on GNSS are given, including the 𝐶∕𝑁0 and pseudorange simulation of the diffracted signal. The performances of both models are assessed using real data from two typical urban scenarios. The result shows the UTD can adequately model the GNSS diffraction effect even in a complicated urban area. Compared with the knife-edge model, the UTD achieves better modeling accuracy, whereas it requires higher computational loads.},
