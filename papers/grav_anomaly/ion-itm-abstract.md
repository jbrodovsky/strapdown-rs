# Improving Resilience in GNSS-Degraded Environments Using MEMS Sensors: A Gravity Anomaly-Aided Navigation Approach

## Abstract

**Objectives**: This work explores the efficacy of integrating open-source gravity anomaly data into a strapdown inertial navigation system (INS) to improve navigation performance during periods of degraded or intermittent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) availability. The primary objective is to demonstrate that a geophysical-aided INS, utilizing only low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) grade sensors and publicly available gravity maps, can achieve a navigation solution with a lower drift rate than a comparable INS that is not geophysically aided. The research aims to provide a proof-of-concept for a viable, non-radio frequency (RF) based alternative to GNSS that is particularly relevant for low-cost, mass-market applications.

**Methodology**: The methodology involves a multi-stage approach. First, a comprehensive, long-term trajectory dataset (MEMS-Nav) was collected using a smartphone's internal MEMS-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU) and GPS receiver. This dataset includes a high-fidelity "truth" trajectory generated from a loosely coupled, Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based INS. Second, the GPS data in the MEMS-Nav dataset is systematically degraded using the strapdown-rs toolbox to simulate various GNSS-challenged scenarios, including reduced update rates, signal degradation (multipath and interference), and intermittent availability. Third, a new UKF-based INS is developed that incorporates gravity anomaly measurements as an additional aiding source. This geophysical INS uses the open-source International Gravity Field Service (IGFS) Earth free-air anomaly map as its reference. The UKF model is augmented to include a gravity anomaly measurement model and its associated measurement noise covariance, allowing the filter to estimate and correct for navigation errors based on deviations from the expected gravity field.

**Results**: The geophysical-aided INS was able to provide several positive benefits compared to the standard INS. First, on some trajectories the gravity aided INS was able to achieve more accurate navigation solutions than the standard INS typically by a few meters but ranging up to 15 to 19 meters. Even when unable to beat the performance of the standard INS, the geophysical INS demonstrated behavior that trended towards exceeding the performance of the standard INS. The results show that even with the inherent noise of MEMS-grade IMUs and limited resolution of open-source gravity maps, this approach can effectively constrain INS drift, providing a more robust and resilient navigation solution than a standalone INS.

**Conclusions and Significance**: The research concludes that integrating a gravity anomaly approach into a UKF-based INS is a viable method for enhancing navigation performance in GNSS-denied or degraded environments. This work demonstrates that using low-cost MEMS sensors, commonly found in smartphones, combined with publicly available geophysical data, can provide a significant improvement in navigation accuracy. The findings are particularly significant for applications in autonomous systems, robotics, and aerospace where resilience to GNSS vulnerabilities is critical. This approach offers a compelling non-RF based complement to GNSS, contributing to the development of a more robust and secure PNT ecosystem.

## Innovation

The primary innovation lies in the combination of publicly available, low-cost resources to achieve a useful navigation solution, via direct integration into the INS. While gravity-aided navigation is not a new concept this work makes it accessible and relevant to mass-market applications and demonstrates a reasonable lower bound of accuracy and performance. Historically, this type of navigation required expensive, specialized sensors like gravimeters or gravity gradiometers. This approach uses readily available MEMS-grade sensors from a standard smartphone and open-source gravity anomaly maps. This fundamentally changes the cost and accessibility barrier, opening the door for its use in consumer devices and low-cost autonomous systems.
