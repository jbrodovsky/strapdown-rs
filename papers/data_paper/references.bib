The work relies on well-established methods of potential field inversion and introduces a new analytic formulation designed to stabilize the solution of the inverse problem in real-time applications. The navigation method proposed exploits the terrain information associated with geomagnetic field anomalies, without the need of a priori maps. The procedure can also be applied to track a moving vehicle based on its associated disturbance of the environmental magnetic field. We envision the integration of theses methods in terrain-aided navigation systems, simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms, and tracking applications.}

	ABSTRACT = {Simulation tests were accomplished in this paper to evaluate the performance of gravity matching aided navigation (GMAN). Four essential factors were focused in this study to quantitatively evaluate the performance: gravity database (DB) resolution, fitting degree of gravity measurements, number of samples in matching, and gravity changes in the matching area. Marine gravity anomaly DB derived from satellite altimetry was employed. Actual dynamic gravimetry accuracy and operating conditions were referenced to design the simulation parameters. The results verified that the improvement of DB resolution, gravimetry accuracy, number of measurement samples, or gravity changes in the matching area generally led to higher positioning accuracies, while the effects of them were different and interrelated. Moreover, three typical positioning accuracy targets of GMAN were proposed, and the conditions to achieve these targets were concluded based on the analysis of several different system requirements. Finally, various approaches were provided to improve the positioning accuracy of GMAN.},

abstract = {Satellite radar altimetry collected during a number of geodetic missions has provided a new understanding of the topography and tectonics of the deep oceans. As altimeter performance and coverage improves, smaller structures are revealed. Here we investigate the contribution of six altimeter missions that have been placed into geodetic mapping phases for more than one year. Two types of evaluations are performed. We first compare the composite (all six altimeters) grids of east and north vertical deflection to matching grids where one altimeter has been omitted evaluate their contribution versus latitude. We then estimate the noise in each altimeter by computing the median absolute deviation of the profiles with the best composite grid. Both analyses show that SARAL/AltiKa provides the greatest contribution and ERS-1 no longer provides any significant improvement. The major limitation for recovering small scale gravity features is the sea surface roughness from ocean waves. There have been steady improvements in instrumentation and processing methods that will continue into the future with higher frequency radars and interferometric swath altimeters planned for future missions.}

abstract = {EGM2008 is a spherical harmonic model of the Earth's gravitational potential, developed by a least squares combination of the ITG-GRACE03S gravitational model and its associated error covariance matrix, with the gravitational information obtained from a global set of area-mean free-air gravity anomalies defined on a 5 arc-minute equiangular grid. This grid was formed by merging terrestrial, altimetry-derived, and airborne gravity data. Over areas where only lower resolution gravity data were available, their spectral content was supplemented with gravitational information implied by the topography. EGM2008 is complete to degree and order 2159, and contains additional coefficients up to degree 2190 and order 2159. Over areas covered with high quality gravity data, the discrepancies between EGM2008 geoid undulations and independent GPS/Leveling values are on the order of ±5 to ±10 cm. EGM2008 vertical deflections over USA and Australia are within ±1.1 to ±1.3 arc-seconds of independent astrogeodetic values. These results indicate that EGM2008 performs comparably with contemporary detailed regional geoid models. EGM2008 performs equally well with other GRACE-based gravitational models in orbit computations. Over EGM96, EGM2008 represents improvement by a factor of six in resolution, and by factors of three to six in accuracy, depending on gravitational quantity and geographic area. EGM2008 represents a milestone and a new paradigm in global gravity field modeling, by demonstrating for the first time ever, that given accurate and detailed gravimetric data, asingle global model may satisfy the requirements of a very wide range of applications.},
