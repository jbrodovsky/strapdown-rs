This is a project implementing core functionality for an inertial navigation system, primarily used for developing the overall navigation filters. At a base level it should have IMU data that describes relative motion.

The project is written in Rust and should follow idiomatic Rust conventions as well as common software design practices concerning modularity, readability, and maintainability. The code should be well-structured, with clear separation of concerns and appropriate use of modules and crates.

The code should be organized into modules that reflect the functionality of the system. Each module should have a clear purpose and should be named accordingly. The main module should serve as an entry point for the application, while other modules should encapsulate specific functionalities such as data processing, filtering, and sensor fusion.

The code should be well-documented, with clear and concise comments explaining the purpose of each module, function, and data structure. The documentation should also include examples of how to use the various components of the system.
