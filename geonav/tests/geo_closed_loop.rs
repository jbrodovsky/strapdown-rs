//! Until this existed, nothing ran the geophysical closed loop from a map on disk through to a
//! finished solution. `run_geo_closed_loop_cli` carried a comment saying it had no test at all,
//! and the consequence was that the feature could not complete a single run: the filters carry
//! one bias state per active map, `NavigationResult`'s conversion asserted a flat fifteen, and
//! every run died on its first result regardless of filter or map.
//!
//! The assertion was right to exist -- a wrong state shape really is a crate invariant
//! violation -- so the fix was to tell the conversion what the extra states are rather than to
//! loosen it. These tests hold both halves of that: a geophysical run completes and labels its
//! bias column, and a run that declares no geophysical states still rejects a longer state.
